title: "Saltwater Irrigation"
status: "early-idea"
category: "water"  # <-- NEW! Add this to group projects together
summary: "Exploring strategies for salinity-tolerant cultivation and soil recovery."
lastUpdated: "October 2025"
description: "Exploring strategies for salinity-tolerant cultivation and soil recovery using plasma-activated water."

# At a Glance
challenge: "Saline encroachment threatens food security globally. Rising sea levels and poor irrigation practices increase soil salinity. Current approaches rely on expensive desalination or abandoning land."

approach: "Can plasma-activated saltwater support crop growth? Which species tolerate treated saline water? Can PAW accelerate soil remediation after salinization?"

currentStatus: "Literature review phase. Seeking partners with agronomy expertise, access to test plots, and communities facing salinity challenges."

# Research Questions
researchQuestions:
  - "Can plasma activation of saline water reduce its harmful effects on plant growth?"
  - "Which crop species and cultivars show tolerance to PAW-treated saltwater irrigation?"
  - "Does PAW application influence soil salinity levels over time through remediation mechanisms?"
  - "What are the optimal plasma treatment parameters for different salinity levels?"
  - "How do PAW treatments compare to conventional approaches (leaching, gypsum amendment, phytoremediation)?"

# What We're Looking For
expertise:
  - "Soil scientists and agronomists"
  - "Plant physiologists familiar with salinity stress"

## Why This Matters

Soil salinization affects millions of hectares worldwide, particularly in coastal regions and areas with intensive irrigation. Traditional remediation methods are costly, energy-intensive, or simply abandon affected land. As climate change accelerates sea level rise and alters precipitation patterns, the problem will only intensify.

Meanwhile, plasma-activated water (PAW) shows promise in agricultural applications â€” but most research focuses on freshwater systems. Understanding tolerance thresholds and recovery pathways under saline conditions is critical for coastal and arid regions.
