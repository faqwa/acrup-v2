      <h1 id="about-title">About Ali</h1>
      <p class="about-lede">arc^ is my work — a framework I'm building to do science differently. If it grows, it becomes something bigger: a foundation, circle, or collective. Whatever we choose. But right now, it's under my CCs, and I'm inviting you into the process.</p>

    <!-- WHO I AM -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm an undergraduate biological science student at a university in Melbourne, Australia, majoring in environmental and ecological systems. My applied work has focused on triboelectric nanogenerators and pollutant breakdown, as well as saltmarsh restoration research.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working toward an honours project that aligns with arc^'s framework — research that's open, collaborative, and grounded in regenerative principles rather than extractive ones.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY ARC^ -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why arc^?</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>arc^ began with a question: <em>if I make the same choices as the people before me, what world does that create?</em></p>
        <p>I couldn't justify entering a system that prioritizes profit over ecosystems, patents over open knowledge, or individual recognition over collective benefit. So I decided to build something different.</p>
        <p>arc^ is my attempt to create a research framework that refuses those old paradigms — one that starts with transparency, safety, and planetary wellbeing. It's messy, evolving, and far from perfect. But it's honest.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT'S NEXT -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>Right now, arc^ is just me and the framework I'm building. I'm hoping it grows beyond my idea into something bigger — a collective group of independent individuals working together toward regenerative futures.</p>
        <p>If this takes off, I see it transforming into a foundation, circle, or whatever structure serves the community best. That's not a decision I'll make alone. The form should emerge from the people who contribute.</p>
        <p>For now, it's early. Everything is still being developed. The most valuable contribution is conversation, co-design, and helping build the methods together.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- MY ROLE -->
    <section class="about-role surface-panel">
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>I'm the initiator, not the owner. I built the framework and set the principles, but arc^ is designed to grow beyond me. My job is to steward the vision, maintain the standards, and invite others into the process.</p>
      <p>If you're here, you're early. That means you have a chance to shape what this becomes.</p>
